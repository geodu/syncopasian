  <p style="text-align: justify;">"What song should I sing?" -- Pick a song that you like and suits your singing style. Don't feel pressured to audition with a song just because you think we'll like it. If you're enjoying it, we'll enjoy it too! "What if I don't speak an Asian language?" -- Identifying as Asian/speaking an Asian language is NOT a requirement nor a consideration in our audition process. We welcome people of all identities and backgrounds! "But I've never sung in an a cappella group/chorus/vocal ensemble before!" -- No experience is necessary to join our group. Many of our members have never sung in public or had vocal training before coming to MIT, so we hope that encourages you to give the audition a try! </p>
