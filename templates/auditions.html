   <b>Welcome to MIT!</b>
  <br>
  Here’s your chance to join our family (upperclassmen, transfer students, and graduate students are also welcome)! Information about our audition process for the Spring 2018 cycle is below:
  <ul>
  	<li>WHEN: Saturday 9/2 – all day (it only takes ~10 minutes!)</li>
  	<li>WHERE: Room 4-152</li>
  	<li>SIGN UP:  Sign up for a time slot at the ASA Activities Midway (Friday 9/1 @ Johnson Ice Rink). E-mail <a href="mailto:syncopasian@mit.edu" target="_blank">syncopasian@mit.edu</a> if you cannot make it to the Midway or if you have a time conflict with auditions. We accept walk-ins, but you may have to wait for an open time slot.</li>
  	<li>AUDITION PROCESS: Please prepare a verse and chorus from a song of your choice (English or any language is fine). Along with this song, you will be asked to complete a few warm-up techniques and a sight-singing excerpt.</li>
  </ul>
  <br>
  A few words of advice:
  <ul>
  	<li>Relax! We don’t bite ^_^</li>
  	<li>Pick a song that suits your singing style and shows off what you can do–DON’T pick a song just because you think we’ll like it. If you’re into your song, we will be too!</li>
  	<li>“But I don’t speak Chinese/Japanese/Korean?” – being Asian or speaking an Asian language is definitely NOT a requirement.</li>
  </ul>
  <br>
  Can't wait to meet all of you!! <3
