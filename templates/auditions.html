  <b>Welcome to MIT Syncopasian!</b>
  <br>
  Stay tuned for information about Synco's Fall 2020 auditions! We'll announce more details closer to when the school year begins.
  <br>
  <br>
  <b>Audition Format</b>: Please prepare a verse and chorus from a song of your choice to sing at the audition (English or any language is fine!). The audition will begin with a few warm-up exercises to help ready your voice for your song. After your song, you may be asked to complete a sight-singing excerpt.
  <br>
  <br>
  Feel free to email us at syncopasian@mit.edu if you have any further questions!

  <h1>How Auditions Work</h1>
  <p>
    Auditions typically take place over the course of a few days before the Fall semester begins. The audition process begins with an initial <b>solo audition</b>. We will lead you through a few scales and other warm-up exercises to get a better feel for your voice, then ask you to perform a verse and a chorus from a song of your choice (English or any language is fine!). After your song, you may be asked to complete a sight-singing excerpt, and we'll tell you about logistics for <b>callbacks</b>. The first round audition overall takes around five minutes.
  </p>

  <p>
    After your first round audition, you may be contacted about <b>callbacks</b>, where you'll learn an excerpt from a previous Synco arrangement and sing it with members of Synco and other auditionees. At callbacks, we want to get a sense of how you sound in the group, and also give you a chance to get to know Synco and its culture better by talking with current members.

  <h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
  <ul>
    <li>"What song should I sing?" -- Pick a song that you like and suits your singing style. Don't feel pressured to audition with a song just because you think we'll like it. If you're enjoying it, we'll enjoy it too!</li>

    <li>"What if I don't speak an Asian language?" -- Identifying as Asian/speaking an Asian language is neither a requirement nor a consideration in our audition process. We welcome people of all identities and backgrounds!</li>

    <li>"But I've never sung in an a cappella group/chorus/vocal ensemble before!" -- No experience is necessary to join our group. Many of our members have never sung in public or had vocal training before coming to MIT, so we hope that encourages you to give the audition a try! </li>

    <li>"How many people will you be taking?" -- Though the group usually is around 15 people, Syncopasian doesn't have caps or quotas. Our audition decisions any given year are entirely a function of the auditionees and how they fit within the group, and not things like total size of the group. </li>

    <li>"I'm really nervous about my audition. *~* " -- Try to relax before hand! Auditions can be scary but we're super excited to hear your voice! Feel free to ask us questions throughout the audition if you're confused about something. We don't bite :) </li>

    <li>"I can't make auditions, what should I do?" -- Contact us at syncopasian@mit.edu and we'll try to work something out!</li>
  </ul>
  Can't wait to meet all of you!!!
