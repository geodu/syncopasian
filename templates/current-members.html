        <b>Hometown</b>: Albany, CA
        <br><b>Major</b>: Course VII (Biology)
        <br><b>Vocal Part</b>: Soprano
        <br>"Did you know that Madeline began her evolution 20 million years ago in the South China Sea? At the time, she was nothing like the Madeline we are familiar with today. For thousands of years, she was allowed to grow wild and was most likely a hard, inedible fruit. Over time, and travel, Madeline not only became edible but a precious soprano commodity as choral music developed. It is thought that on his second voyage to the New World in 1493, Christopher Columbus landed in the Grand Canary Island where he purchased, among other things, Madeline seeds. While establishing a colony in 1493, he formed orchards in Hispaniola. As a result, the Singing Gardens of Madeline were established in Haiti and San Salvadore. In 1513, Madelines were introduced to Florida by Ponce De Leon, to California in 1769, and in the 1880′s to Texas by early Spanish missionaries. The first commercial recording of Madeline was made in 1921."
