Over his many trips across Siberia to gather medicinal herbs and potatoes, he wrote volumes of medical guides which now provide the foundation for Lunar spells in Runescape."

        <br>"Raymond lived in Canada for six years and was shocked upon moving to California that people did not commute via either snowmobile or polar bear. Compared to that, the more recent transition to Cambridge and MIT has been a snap. Raymond first learned to sing by imitating beaver calls while hunting their pelts in the tundra. Ever since joining Synco, Raymond’s budgeted daily video game time has been cut in half. But at least so far, he feels it’s been worth it."

…At least that’s how she should be introducing herself…
When she’s not in rehearsal, you may find ​Priyanka doing one of the following activities: making a chip butty in the McCormick dining hall, wandering around Boston for a new restaurant to visit, fighting for one of the left-handed seats in 66-110, hacking (shhhhh), playing her didgeridoo at odd hours, watching Adventure Time, pretending to be good at badminton, playing her Otamatone at odder hours, or using her status as a Course X as an excuse not to go out tonight. And psetting. She definitely sometimes maybe once in a while does that, too. Leedle leedle."
