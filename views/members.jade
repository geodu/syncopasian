            | "Alex is a young person in a busy world who loves simplicity. He enjoys long walks along the esplanade, trying new things, and deep discussions about life and the universe. He loves food too much for his own good, and oscillates between extroverted and introverted very quickly and suddenly. In his free time, Alex will often be found on the tennis court, coding quietly in a corner, or laughing loudly with friends."

            | "Nick did have a rebellious period at the beginning of his vampire life and left Carlisle and Esme in 1927. During his lone time, he used his mind reading ability to attack the worst people of society, thinking that, as long as he was serving justice, it would not matter that he was feeding on humans. His first victim was Esme's abusive ex-husband,Charles Evenson. A few years later, he regretted this decision and returned to Carlisle's family and their diet of animal blood in 1931."

After Thom left his successful career with the Union army, he used his musical talents to provide alternative healing to patients of hemophilia in Russia. Over his many trips across Siberia to gather medicinal herbs and potatoes, he wrote volumes of medical guides which now provide the foundation for Lunar spells in Runescape."

Compared to that, the more recent transition to Cambridge and MIT has been a snap. Raymond first learned to sing by imitating beaver calls while hunting their pelts in the tundra. Ever since joining Synco, Raymond's budgeted daily video game time has been cut in half. But at least so far, he feels it's been worth it."
